The most commonly used functions/objects are:

* wandb.init — initialize a new run at the top of your training script
* wandb.config — track hyperparameters
* wandb.log — log metrics over time within your training loop
* wandb.save — save files in association with your run, like model weights
* wandb.restore — restore the state of your code when you ran a given run
