Use the Public API to export or update data that you have saved to W&B.

Before using this API, you'll want to log data from your script â€” check the [Quickstart](https://github.com/charlesfrye/docs-box/tree/1556da259cd7af093524c310c4c6c9746f69ced3/ref/quickstart.md) for more details.

**Use Cases for the Public API**

* **Export Data**: Pull down a dataframe for custom analysis in a Jupyter Notebook. Once you have explored the data, you can sync your findings by creating a new analysis run and logging results, for example: `wandb.init(job_type="analysis")`
* **Update Existing Runs**: You can update the data logged in association with a W&B run. For example, you might want to update the config of a set of runs to include additional information, like the architecture or a hyperparameter that wasn't originally logged.

See the [Generated Reference Docs](https://github.com/charlesfrye/docs-box/tree/1556da259cd7af093524c310c4c6c9746f69ced3/ref/ref/public-api/README.md) for details on available functions.
